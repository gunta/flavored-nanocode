# nanocode - OpenProse Edition
# A minimal agentic coding assistant in OpenProse
# See: https://prose.md/

# Define the coding agent
agent coder:
  model: sonnet
  prompt: "You are a concise coding assistant. Use tools to read, write, edit files, search with glob/grep, and run shell commands. Be direct and helpful."

# Main interaction loop - keep coding until the user is satisfied
loop until **the user says goodbye or quits**:
  session: coder
    prompt: "Help the user with their coding task. Read files to understand context, make edits as needed, run commands to verify changes. Ask clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous."

# ---
# OpenProse runs on any Prose Complete system (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp).
# The session itself has file and shell access - no tool definitions needed.
# Natural language becomes executable in the AI era.
