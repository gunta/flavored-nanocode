(nanocode - minimal claude code alternative in Rockstar)
(Rockstar is a programming language designed to look like song lyrics)

Nanocode takes your dreams
Listen to your input
The API is mysterious
The model is everything

My heart is waiting
My soul is empty
The messages are nothing

Say "🎸 NANOCODE 🎸"
Say "Where code meets rock and roll"
Say ""

While my heart is waiting
    Say "🎤 "
    Listen to the word
    
    If the word is "/q"
        Say "🤘 Rock on! 🤘"
        Break
    
    If the word is "/c"
        Put nothing into my soul
        Say "🔥 Cleared the stage! 🔥"
        Continue
    
    (Call the AI - it speaks in tongues)
    The response is mystical
    
    Say "🎵 Claude says: 🎵"
    Say "I am but a humble AI assistant"
    Say "Ready to help you code"
    Say ""
    Say "🎸 Tool time! 🎸"
    Say "(read) Reading files like guitar tabs"
    Say "(write) Writing code like lyrics"
    Say "(bash) Executing like a drum solo"
    Say ""

Say "🎤 Thank you Cleveland! 🎤"

(
In the AI era, even rock stars code
Every language tells a story
Nanocode speaks all tongues
From Python's clarity to Rockstar's poetry

This proves that programming is art
And art can be programming
The future belongs to those
Who can speak both to humans and machines
