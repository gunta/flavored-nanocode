The Nanocode Tragedy.
A coding assistant of most minimal nature.

Romeo, a young developer seeking answers.
Juliet, the AI assistant of great wisdom.
Hamlet, the tool executor of decisive action.
The Ghost, an error handler most spectral.

                    Act I: The Initialization.
                    Scene I: The Terminal Awakens.

[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
 Thou art as lovely as the sum of a cat and a warm peaceful fair summer's day!
 Speak thy mind!

Juliet:
 I am nanocode, thy humble servant.
 Ask and ye shall receive wisdom.

                    Scene II: The REPL Loop.

[Enter Hamlet]

Hamlet:
 To code or not to code, that is the query!

Romeo:
 Listen to thy heart! Open thy mind!

Juliet:
 If thy query be "/q", let us part ways most gracefully.
 If thy query be "/c", let memories fade like morning mist.

Hamlet:
 What tools dost thou require, noble user?
 Shall I READ the ancient scrolls of files?
 Shall I WRITE new verses to the disk?
 Shall I execute BASH commands most powerful?

                    Act II: The Tool Execution.
                    Scene I: Reading Files.

Romeo:
 Hamlet, fetch me the contents of yon file!

Hamlet:
 [Reads the file with great theatrical pause]
 Behold! Line the first! Line the second!
 And so forth until the final act!

                    Scene II: Writing Files.

Juliet:
 The quill is mightier than the sword!
 Let us inscribe these words for posterity!

Hamlet:
 It is done! The file hath been written!
 Success most glorious!

                    Act III: The Response.
                    Scene I: Claude Speaks.

Juliet:
 [Speaking as the AI oracle]
 Dear user, I have pondered thy request.
 Mine answer comes from vast neural networks,
 Trained upon the collected works of humanity.
 
 What wouldst thou have me do?
 I am but a humble language model,
 Yet capable of wonders most computational!

                    The Epilogue.

[Exeunt all]

Romeo:
 Thus concludes our noble experiment,
 Where Shakespeare meets silicon dreams.
 In the age of AI, all languages speak,
 Even the Bard himself would be impressed!

[THE END]
