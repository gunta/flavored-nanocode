In Befunge, code flows in 2D:
  > moves right
  < moves left
  ^ moves up
  v moves down
  
The @ symbol ends the program.
Numbers and strings go on the stack.
, outputs a character.

Why Befunge in the AI era?
- Shows code can be visual/spatial
- Challenges linear thinking
- AI could potentially "see" 2D code
- Future programming might be spatial

The stack-based nature of Befunge
is similar to how transformers work:
pushing and popping attention patterns.
