PLEASE NOTE nanocode - minimal claude code alternative (INTERCAL)
PLEASE NOTE The Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym
PLEASE NOTE INTERCAL was created in 1972 as a parody of programming languages

PLEASE DO ,1 <- #78
DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 <- #256
DO ,1 SUB #5 <- #64
DO ,1 SUB #6 <- #194
DO ,1 SUB #7 <- #48
DO ,1 SUB #8 <- #22
PLEASE READ OUT ,1
PLEASE NOTE This prints "NANOCODE"

PLEASE NOTE In INTERCAL, we must be polite or the program fails!
PLEASE NOTE Too many PLEASEs = error. Too few = error.

DO .1 <- #0
DO .2 <- #0

PLEASE NOTE Main loop (conceptually)
(1) DO .1 <- .1
    PLEASE NOTE Check for /q command
    DO (2) NEXT
    PLEASE FORGET #1
    DO (1) NEXT

(2) DO .2 <- #1
    PLEASE NOTE Process input
    DO RESUME #1

PLEASE NOTE Tool execution would require:
PLEASE NOTE INTERLEAVE for string manipulation
PLEASE NOTE MINGLE for bit operations
PLEASE NOTE SELECT for extraction
PLEASE NOTE But honestly, nobody should actually do this

PLEASE NOTE Why INTERCAL in the AI era?
PLEASE NOTE 1. Proves Turing completeness of absurdity
PLEASE NOTE 2. Tests AI's ability to understand sarcasm
PLEASE NOTE 3. If AI can write INTERCAL, we're in trouble
PLEASE NOTE 4. The COME FROM statement predicts goto-less async

PLEASE GIVE UP

PLEASE NOTE The real nanocode is the friends we made along the way
