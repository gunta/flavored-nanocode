This is a Malbolge program that represents nanocode conceptually.

Malbolge is the most difficult programming language ever created.
It was specifically designed to be nearly impossible to use.

The language features:
- Self-modifying code
- Ternary (base-3) logic  
- Three registers with confusing semantics
- Encrypted instructions

This "program" above prints a single character.
A full nanocode implementation in Malbolge would take
approximately 10^100 years to write.

Why include Malbolge in nanocode?

In the AI era, Malbolge represents the ultimate challenge:
1. Can AI understand intentionally obfuscated code?
2. Can AI generate programs in hostile languages?
3. Does difficulty have meaning when AI can try billions of variations?

The irony: Malbolge programs are now generated by genetic algorithms
and machine learning - AI writes the "impossible" language.

Historical note:
The first Malbolge program that printed "Hello World" was found
using beam search in 2000, taking several weeks of computation.
Today's AI could probably find it in seconds.

The real lesson: There is no program too weird for AI to attempt.

nanocode in Malbolge would be:
- Tool execution via self-modification
- API calls via cosmic ray bit flips
- REPL via quantum tunneling
- Actually just pain

If you're reading this and considering implementing it:
Please don't.
