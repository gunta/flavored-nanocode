nanocode in Brainfuck - The Esoteric AI Agent
Note: This prints "NANOCODE" and demonstrates the concept
A real implementation would need an extended BF interpreter

[
This is where the magic would happen
In theory you could implement an AI agent in BF
But it would take approximately 10 million cells
And would be unreadable even by AI standards

The tool schema would be:
,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,  (read 10 chars for tool name)
[->+>+<<]            (process)
>>>[<<<+>>>-]        (execute)
<<<.                 (output result)

But lets be honest - this is just for fun
If youre actually trying to run an AI agent in Brainfuck
You might want to reconsider your life choices

However in the AI era this proves a point:
Even the most minimal language can express computation
And with enough cells anything is Turing complete
