Below is the explanation (in visible comments):

=== NANOCODE in Whitespace ===

Whitespace is a language where only spaces, tabs, and newlines
are significant. Everything else is a comment!

This implementation demonstrates that even the most minimal
syntax can express computation. In the AI era, this proves
that intelligence can emerge from the simplest building blocks.

Tool Schema (in concept):
  [space][space][space] = READ
  [space][space][tab]   = WRITE  
  [space][tab][space]   = BASH
  [space][tab][tab]     = GLOB
  [tab][space][space]   = GREP

The actual Whitespace code above:
1. Pushes ASCII values onto the stack
2. Outputs them as characters
3. Spells out "NANOCODE"

In the AI era, Whitespace teaches us:
- Meaning can be encoded anywhere
- What looks like nothing can be everything
- AI models see patterns humans miss
- Even "empty" code has structure

To run: ws nanocode.ws
(Requires a Whitespace interpreter)
